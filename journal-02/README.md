The Nintendo Switch has one of the most impressive user experiences I have used in a long time. Every action feels like it has been hand crafted just for the user's enjoyment. For example, opening the store on the console is an exerience in itself.

When the user opens the store, they first must navigate to its icon. This task is exceptionally easy as all common applications are laid out beneath your regular applications making regular actions highly **efficient** to get to. The user must simply tap the joystick down button and click the 'store' icon. The joystick's own **affordance** helps the user figure out this process by labeling each button with an arrow to guide the user. It is also a process the user is likely to want to keep coming back to as anytime the user presses a button, a sound plays that leaves the them immensely **satisfied**. 

However, the user experience is not perfect. In an effert to maximize **satisfaction**, it seems Nintendo has sacrificed its ability to be **efficient** in some areas. For example, anytime a user clicks a button, a nice little animation will play. This is pleasent at first but after a while it becomes frustrating to wait for. 

Overrall, the Nintendo Switch user experience is highly enjoyable. From its immensily **satisfying** use, to its natural **affordance**, the Nintendo Switch is something I will certainly be drawing inspiration from for my own usability engineering projects.
