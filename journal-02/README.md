The Nintendo Switch has one of the most impressive user experiences I have used in a very long time. Every action feels like it has been hand crafted just for the user's enjoyment. For example, opening the store on the console is an exerience in itself.

When the user opens the store, they first must navigate to its' icon. This task is exceptionally easy as all common applications are laid out beneath your regular applications. The user must simply tap the joystick down and click the 'store' icon. Each click plays a sound that leaves the user immensely [b]satisfied[/b].
