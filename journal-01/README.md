The 2013 Ford Fusion console is a truly horrific bit of usability engineering. In order to perform otherwise simple tasks, such as pausing a CD, you must perform a series of complex tasks. First, you must click the 'CD' button. A simple enough task that is also **learnable** since learning button placement is generally easy. 

The console then attempts to use **mapping** (the relation between a control and its' outcome) to its advantage. It attempts to map the four buttons below the display with the four buttons on the display. Unfortunately, it does this very poorly. For one, the buttons are not quite in the same spot and are shaped very differently than their display counterparts. Worst of all, the buttons on the display change constantly depending on the screen making it not **learnable** at all. This results in the user having to divert their attention from the road and onto the display. Something that is not at all **safe**. 

The console's lack of **learnablity** makes it lack in **efficiency**. Since the user is unable to learn the way the console works, they must continually look from the buttons to the console and, if they are the driver, the road. This is not at all **efficient** and will take a long time to simply pause a CD. 

Overall, the user experience for the 2013 Ford Fusion console is abysmal. It uses **mapping** poorly, is not at all **learnable**, which makes it lack **efficiency**, and it is in no way **safe**.
