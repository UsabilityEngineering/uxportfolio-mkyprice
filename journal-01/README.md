The 2013 Ford Fusion console is a truly horrific bit of usability engineering. In order to perform otherwise simple tasks, such as pausing a CD, you must perform a series of complex tasks. First, you must click the 'CD' button. A simple enough task and **learnable** since learning button placement is generally easy. 

The console then attempts to use **mapping** (the relation between a control and its' outcome) to its advantage. It attempts to map the four buttons below the display with the four buttons on the display. Unfortunately, it does this very poorly. For one, the buttons are not in the same spot as their display counterparts. They are also shaped very differently, making it not very **learnable**. This results in the user having to divert their attention from the road and onto the display. Something that is not at all **safe**.
