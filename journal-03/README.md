The Amazon homepage is a shinning example of how not to design a webpage. With hundreds of buttons on screen at once, performing otherwise simple tasks such as shopping for a pair of headphones is now miserable task.

When a user attempts to do this, they will soon realize Amazon has multiple buttons for the exact same task resulting in a far too much **noise**. In other words, a crowded interface which impares how **effective** their store is. **Effectiveness** determines how well the users accomplish their goals and when they are trying to figure out which button to use and where it is in the maze-like interface, they will not be able to accomplish much. Such a complicated interface also reduces its **learnability** and **efficiency**. If they were to get rid of the extra buttons, and simply have the search bar and drop-down, users would be far less overwhelmed.

When the user does decide to use the search bar, they will likely also use the dropdown to the left to find what department their product is in. Unfortunately, this would be a mistake as the sheer amount of information would overwhelm anyone. It could, however, be solved by a **visual hierarchy** in which the options are are grouped and put into sub menus to make it far more **effective** as the user would be able to find the department they are looking for.

Overall, it seems as if Amazon continues to add features and never lets their old ones die. This results in an overwhelming interface that lacks **effectiveness**, **learnability**, and **efficiency** and consists of too much noise. Many of these issues could be solved with a **visual hierarchy** and a reduction of **noise**.
